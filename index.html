                        Having the best gaming PC doesn't necessarily mean having a computer with all the latest and greatest components. Whether to you, that means getting an affordable one under $1,000 that offers smooth 1080p gaming or splurging on a kitted out option touting the most powerful components, is more the point. What’s important is that you’re getting a PC that will see you through your gaming needs and is within your budget.

                        Although there’s always the option of building your own PC for gaming, a lot of people still think that buying a pre-built gaming PC is the best and most convenient way to go. Luckily, investing in such a system isn’t going to be pricey. In fact, it often costs less. And, we’re here to help you make the right choice.

                            These days, an 8GB DDR4 memory is the minimum, but upgrade to 16GB if you can.

                            Plenty of SSD storage is ideal as well, since many top titles take up a lot of space.

                        Finally, make sure you have enough money for quality peripherals as well. After all, a gaming PC is only as good as its peripherals. Only when coupled with the best gaming monitor and the best gaming keyboards will yours be the stuff of legends.
